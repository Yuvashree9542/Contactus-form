## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/contact-form.git
   cd contact-form
   ```

2. **Update the form action (optional):**

   If you'd like to use your own Formspree endpoint, replace the `action` value in the form tag with your own:

   ```html
   <form action="https://formspree.io/f/yourformid" method="POST">
   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in your browser** or deploy using GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

## 🔒 Form Handling (Formspree)

To receive submissions:

* Go to [Formspree](https://formspree.io/)
* Set up a new form and get your unique `action` URL
* Replace the default URL in the `<form>` tag with your own

## 💡 Customization

* 🎨 **Colors**: Update the `background`, `border`, and `button` styles in the CSS.
* 🔤 **Fonts**: Replace the `Poppins` font with any other Google Font by modifying the `<link>` in the `<head>`.
* 📏 **Layout**: Adjust the container `max-width` or padding for a different layout.
